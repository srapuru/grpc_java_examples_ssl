1) Instructions:

git clone 
Create the certs using the script gen.sh

2)Look at the client-ext.cnf and server-ext.cnf files, I have added another DNS:testing, use his while creating certs

3) Add  the following entry into /etc/hosts file, which is very important

127.0.0.1   testing

4) I have used "testing" as service authority in grpc-client App.java file as shown below.

public NameResolver newNameResolver(URI notUsedUri, NameResolver.Args args) {
        System.out.println("====IN newNameResolver fun "+notUsedUri + ", and args are ---"+ args);
        System.out.println("====IN  URI,"+notUsedUri.getScheme());
        return new NameResolver() {
            @Override
            public String getServiceAuthority() {
                System.out.println("====IN newNameResolver getService  ");
                return
                        "testing";
               
            }
            public void start(Listener2 listener) {
                System.out.println("====IN newNameResolver start  ");
                listener.onResult(ResolutionResult.newBuilder().setAddresses(addresses).setAttributes(Attributes.EMPTY).build());

            }
            public void shutdown() {
                System.out.println("====IN newNameResolver shut  ");
            }
        };
    }
